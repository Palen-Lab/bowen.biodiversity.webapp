"1","mx","mixed conifer and broadleaf trees (< 75% coniferous and < 75% broadleaf composition)"
"2","co","conifer dominated (> 75% stand composition)"
"3","cs","coastal herbaceous: criteria as for ‘hb’ but influenced by proximity to ocean; windswept shoreline and slopes; > 20% vegetation of grasses, herbs, mosses and lichens."
"4","ff","fringe: narrow linear communities along open water bodies (rivers, streams, lakes and ponds) where there is no floodplain. see Appendix I for mapping guidelines."
"5","sp","swamp: wooded wetlands dominated by 25% or more cover of flood-tolerant trees or shrubs. Swamps are characterized by periodic flooding and nearly permanent sub-surface waterflow through mixtures of mineral and organic materials, swamps are high in nutrient, mineral and oxygen content."
"6","ro","rock outcrop: exposed bedrock, usually at the top of knolls or on portions of steeper slopes."
"7","vs","vegetated shoreline: low-lying rocky shoreline, soil pockets in rock cracks and crevices; salt-tolerant vegetation, generally with < 20% vegetation cover."
"8","mf","mudflats: non-vegetated mudflats or with varying amounts of algae."
"9","gu","gully: watercourse is within a steep sided V-shaped gully or ravine; generally only minimal area of flooding but gully is important due to proximity to water and sensitive due to steeper slopes."
"10","fn","fen: underlain by sedge or brown moss peat, fens are closely related to bogs. In addition to rainfall, fens receive mineral and nutrient-enriched water from upslope drainage or groundwater. Thus a broader range of plants, including shrubs and small trees, is able to grow."
"11","sw","shallow water: wetlands characterized by water less than 2m in depth in mid-summer; transition between deep water bodies and other wetland ecosystems (i.e. bogs, swamps, fens, etc.); often with vegetation rooted below the water surface."
"12","bs","beaches: well- to sparsely-vegetated or non-vegetated beaches and shorelines."
"13","pd","pond: naturally occurring, small body of open water, greater than 2m deep and generally up to 8 ha, with little to no floating vegetation; shallower water than a lake."
"14","bd","broadleaf dominated (> 75% of stand composition), any size."
"15","el","eelgrass: intertidal & shallow subtidal eelgrass beds."
"16","la","lake: naturally occurring, static body of open water greater than 2m deep and generally greater than 8 ha, with little to no floating vegetation; deeper water than a pond."
"17","bg","bog: acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands that characteristically support peat-mosses and ericaceous shrubs such as Labrador tea and bog-rosemary. Being generally isolated from mineral rich groundwater or surface water, their primary source of water and nutrients is from rainfall."
"18","xx","Non SE, ME or YS ecosystem type."
