# streams_fish shapefile

This shapefile has been authored and provided by Alan Whitehead from Whitehead Consultants based on Bowen Island. Provided via email, Whitehead emailed to Wendy Palen and Jay Matsushiba the `streams_fish.shp` layer with following description on April 9th 2025:

> Glad to help. I've attached the shapefile set covering fish distribution. I provided this to BIM many years ago during the development of the Watershed, Aquifer and Stream Protection (WASP) Bylaw that was incorporated into the Land use Bylaw. I subsequently tweaked it as additional information became available during the course of my company's subsequent work. Hopefully they'll be of some use to you.

> Freshwater fish species diversity on Bowen is naturally low and, as you can see from the fish watersheds map, the number of fish-bearing streams/lakes is also low. In hindsight, it's unfortunate I never created a GIS dataset on fish distribution by species. However, this should be relatively easy to do by adding a Species field to the attribute table, populating it from local knowledge and the info contained in the Block 1978 report and possibly other older documents. I can lend a hard copy of the Block report if a digital version isn't available to you.

> The predominant native freshwater fish species is Coastal Cutthroat Trout. Sea-run Cutthroat may also exist (or have existed) in some of the larger streams (e.g., Killarney, Terminal, Lee). Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout were reportedly introduced to Josephine Creek in the early part of the 1900s. Sculpin have been recorded in Killarney Creek. Kokanee have been reported in Grafton Lake though their origin (native or introduced was unknown); it's thought that they are now extirpated. Three-spined Stickleback are present in Grafton, Killarney and Honeymoon lakes.
>
> Anadromous salmonids are present in Killarney, Terminal, Lee, Explosives, and Grafton. Tim Pardee et al. will likely have the up-to-date info on current and historically known anadromous species.
