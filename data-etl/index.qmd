# Introduction

The purpose of this website is to capture and share the analyses for conducting spatial prioritization of conservation areas on Bowen Island. This is part of a greater effort to inform the decision-making and community planning for the Bowen Island Municipality. 

This work should go hand-in-hand with professional environmental consulting on a site-by-site basis to verify our analyses. This analysis extensively uses existing data products provided by academic, government, NGO, and individual contributors. As a result, this work should be verified by professionals at the on-the-ground level when making site specific decisions.

This documentation website summarizes the work conducted by the team from September 2024 to date. 

## Overview

The analyses follow a sequential pipeline from raw data to conservation priorities to action planning. This website documents the complete workflow with numbered steps showing the analysis sequence.

## Quick Start

To run the complete pipeline:

```r
# See README.md for prerequisites (R 4.4+, Zonation5, raw data)
source("00_run_all.R")
```

Full documentation available in [README.md](README.md)

## Pipeline Structure

This project uses a **non-standard R package structure** optimized for clarity and reproducibility:

```
data-etl/
├── data-raw/scripts/    → Numbered ETL scripts (01_setup → 06_threats)
├── analyses/            → Documentation (this website)
├── output-data/         → Processed datasets
├── output-figures/      → Generated maps
└── output-documents/    → Final reports and atlases
```

## Analysis Workflow

### Pipeline Steps

The main analysis follows this numbered sequence:

**01. [Foundation Data](analyses/01_input_foundation.qmd)**
Prepare base layers: study area boundary, analysis mask, roads, trails, parcels, protected areas, zoning, wetlands, and fish-bearing streams. Define coordinate system for all analyses.

**02. [Species](analyses/02_input_species.qmd)**
Prepare 193 species distribution models from 341 available SDMs. Validate species presence using iNaturalist and eBird observations. Assign conservation status weights (Red/Blue list).

**03. [Habitats](analyses/03_input_habitats.qmd)**
Process ~50 habitat layers from TEM, SEI, and consultant data. Include wetlands, streams, forest age classes, and special features (heron colonies). Create human disturbance layer.

**04. [Conservation Values](analyses/04_conservation_values.qmd)**
Run Zonation5 conservation prioritization using 193 species + ~50 habitats. Identify top 10%, 20%, 30% priority areas. Analyze overlap with protected areas and private land.

### Threats

Assess threats to biodiversity and overlay with conservation priorities:

**05. [Development](analyses/05_threats_development.qmd)**
Analyze development pressure using BC Assessment data and parcel analysis. Identify high-value areas at risk.

**06. [Fire](analyses/06_threats_fire.qmd)**
Assess wildfire vulnerability using WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface) data.

### Action

**07. [Protected Areas](analyses/07_protected_areas.qmd)**
Conduct gap analysis: ~18% of island is protected, but 67% of top 30% priorities are on private land. Recommend locations for new protected areas on public land.

### Outputs

**08. [Data Atlas](analyses/08_data_atlas.qmd)**
Comprehensive atlas integrating all analyses with publication-quality maps.

### Supplementary

Additional analyses:
- [Species Richness](analyses/supplementary/species_richness.qmd) - Richness by taxon and threat status
- [Tree Density](analyses/supplementary/tree_density.qmd) - LiDAR-derived canopy analysis
- [iNaturalist](analyses/supplementary/inaturalist.qmd) - Observation data exploration
