# Bowen Wildland Urban Interfaces (WUI)

Exploring the Wildland Urban Interfaces maps (WUI), produced by the Province of British Columbia, with the intention of using this information to assess the threats towards biodiversity during wildfires. These maps take into consideration the fuel load, climate conditions, and human development at the interface between urban and wildland areas. This would work well for our purposes, if it didn't take in human development. For our purposes, we just want to look at biodiversity impacts and not human development. We don't have access to the input layers directly, or some way to subtract the human development from the WUI maps. Therefore, we have chosen not to use the WUI data. 

![Bowen WUI](images/bowen_wui.png) Previous to this step, the KMZ files
were loaded into QGIS and clipped to
`data-raw/bowen_boundary/Bowen_boundary.shp`. This clipped KMZ was saved
as `data-raw/bowen_wui.gpkg`.

  mutate(WUI_PSTA = paste0(WUI, "_", PSTA))

# Assign values to vect to correctly be able to rasterize the levels later
unique(bowen_wui$WUI_PSTA)
d <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  WUI_PSTA = c("No Data (Private Land)_1-4", 
            "Water_1-4",
            "Low_1-4",
            "Moderate_1-4",

bowen_wui_vect <- bowen_wui %>% 
  vect() %>%
  project(bowen_mask) %>%

## Notes on threat due to fire from Tom Sisk

Objective: Index of Vulnerability to Fire. We are not trying to assess
the probability of fire nor how hot it might burn or its behavior.
Instead, we want to know the relative vulnerability to biodiversity loss
due to fire, if habitats were to burn.

Three major components of vulnerability:

1.  Slope. Fires spread more quickly when they move uphill. Relative
    ranking might look like this:

    1 0-10 degree slopes: lower vulnerability
    2 10-30 degrees: moderate vulnerability
    3 Above 30 degrees: higher vulnerability

2.  Aspect. Southerly exposures burn hotter, fire spreads more quickly,
    effects more uniform and destructive than on northern exposures, all
    else being equal. Might consider this as a first approximation: 
    1 0-45: Low vulnerability because fires unlikely to spread as fast or burn as hot 
    2 45-90: moderately low 
    4 90-135: moderately high 
    6 135-225: southerly exposures burn hotter, spread quickly and more
    uniformly 
    4 225-270: Moderately high 
    2 270-315 Moderately low 
    1 315-360: Low vulnerability

3.  Fuels. On Bowen, the main differences in fuel loads have to do with
    whether a location is forested or not forested. Forested areas burn
    hotter and longer and long, hot burns have a more detrimental effect
    that shorter less intense fires. So the main distinctions should be
    made between forested and unforested. Forest stands comprised of
    larger trees are, of course, of higher value to biodiversity than
    denser stands with smaller trees, so we would like to be able to
    distinguish between forest structures to some degree. At the same
    time, when more mesic habitats burn the biodiversity effects tend to
    be high, because species are not adapted to fire. So we will need to
    rank habitats based on the differential effects of forest fuels
    present, as well as the difference in flora and fauna that make
    those locations more or less vulnerable in terms of biodiversity
    loss. 
    First Cut Ranking Scheme: 
    14 Forest, large/old trees 
    10 Forest, mature second growth 
    6 Forest, young regrowth 
    6 Shrublands 
    2 Grasslands: often burn and effects are modest, even positive in some
    cases 
    4 Riparian: seldom burns, but if it burns biodiversity effects
    may be very negative 
    2 Wetlands: seldom burn, more often they create fire breaks 
    0 Water: does not burn, but is vulnerable to ash deposition 
    NA Built environment: NA (default to WUI map when talking about the built environment

I suggest that we think about these basic ideas:

1. We pursue an index of vulnerability, rather than a more
sophisticated approach to modeling fire or adapting an index that was
developed for other purposes (i.e. WUI).

2. We create a simple index that allows us to compare the relative
vulnerability of all locations on Bowen (with the exception of the built
environment).

3. We consider slope, aspect, and fuels by habitat as the three
components of an index.

4. We determine the relative ranks within each of the three components

5. Integrate the scores into an index that produces an aggregate
vulnerability index score for each pixel. As a first approximation, this
should be the additive (sum) of the three components – and then let’s
see how that performs.


- Rationale for score scaling from Tom 
- Calculating rasters from the LiDAR data directly 
- Add together the three components raster

```{r}
# Slope Score
## Create slope raster from LiDAR data
slope <- rast(here("data/bowen_slope.tif"))
## Create matrix of scores
### 1 0-10 degree slopes: lower vulnerability
### 2 10-30 degrees: moderate vulnerability
### 3 Above 30 degrees: higher vulnerability
slope_m <- matrix(c(
  0, 10, 1,
  10, 30, 2,
  30, 91, 3
), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
## Classify original slope raster to slope score 
slope_score <- slope %>%
  classify(slope_m)

# Aspect Score
## Create aspect raster from LiDAR data
aspect <- rast(here("data/bowen_aspect.tif"))
## Create matrix of scores
### 1 0-45: Low vulnerability because fires unlikely to spread as fast or burn as hot 
### 2 45-90: moderately low 
### 4 90-135: moderately high 
### 6 135-225: southerly exposures burn hotter, spread quickly and more uniformly 
### 4 225-270: Moderately high 
### 2 270-315 Moderately low 
### 1 315-360: Low vulnerability
aspect_m <- matrix(c(
  0, 45, 1,
  45, 90, 2,
  90, 135, 4,
  135, 225, 6,
  225, 270, 4,
  270, 315, 2,
  315, 360, 1
), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
## Classify original aspect raster to aspect score 
aspect_score <- aspect %>%
  classify(aspect_m)

# Fuel Score
## Get habitat classes from combination of WUI, MVSEI, TEM, AW layers 
mv_sei <- st_read(here("data-raw/metrovancouver_sensitive_ecosystem_inventory/Sensitive_Ecosystem_Inventory_for_Metro_Vancouver__2020__-5580727563910851507.gpkg")) %>%
  st_transform(project_crs) %>%
  st_crop(bowen_boundary) 

mv_sei_secl_codes <- read.csv(here("data-raw/metrovancouver_sensitive_ecosystem_inventory/SEI_SECl_codes.csv"))

## Generate fuel score raster based on habitat type 
### 14 Forest, large/old trees 
### 10 Forest, mature second growth 
### 6 Forest, young regrowth 
### 6 Shrublands 
### 2 Grasslands: often burn and effects are modest, even positive in some cases 
### 4 Riparian: seldom burns, but if it burns biodiversity effects may be very negative 
### 2 Wetlands: seldom burn, more often they create fire breaks 
### 0 Water: does not burn, but is vulnerable to ash deposition 
### NA Built environment: NA (default to WUI map when talking about the built environment

### Using SEI 
### TODO: use A. Whitehead wetland and freshwater layers 
### Go with the lowest habitat score

### In order to integrate A. Whitehead's layers, need to figure out the order to prioritize layers.
